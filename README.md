# symbolin
quick turn-based strategy game involving a grid

Symbolin will be a two player game when finished, where you can place normal tiles as you gain 'energy', and you can occasionally place activated tiles. If you place the correct configuration of tiles with an activated tile in the correct spot, you can trigger an effect that will either help you, harm the opponent, or change the board state.

Some effects turn on permanent changes, while others remain only while that configuration of tiles exist. Some create a new kind of tile, others simply deal damage to the other player

There will be a set of 7 configurations to start the game, more will be added as developement progresses
